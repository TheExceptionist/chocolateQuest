^^
**not** guaranteed to always pass, go look at the travis history for the last passed build

So, here's the deal:
=======

Chocolatin's long gone and this mod made my world crash every ten seconds (hyperbole much?), so I got up and edited what I needed from this mod myself.

**I'm not going to maintain this mod**, in fact, I hate this codebase with a passion of a thousand burning suns.

But I invite somebody to fork this mod and keep working on it, I barely do java.

Build Instructions
=======

 * Git Clone this repo
 * ./gradlew build
 * Then add the src/assets folder to the .jar gradle built (located at the output/ folder) -- This step was because I didn't bother with automating that part of the process.

## Binaries?

lol I'm not going to bother with distribution, go find a link somewhere or be a man and build it with the instructions above.

Good luck.
